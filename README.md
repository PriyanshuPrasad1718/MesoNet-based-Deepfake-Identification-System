# MesoNet-based Deepfake Identification System

The MesoNet-based Deepfake Identification System is a project aimed at detecting deepfake images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture known as MesoNet. Leveraging a dataset consisting of 190,000 real and fake images, this system achieves an impressive accuracy rate of 86% in distinguishing between real and deepfake images. The effectiveness of the MesoNet model demonstrates its potential in combating the proliferation of synthetic media.
